                    <p>
						About Yakuza Zero, this game was said to be really good by people who’s opinions 
						I can actually respect and i have to say, they are correct but this game does not 
						go without its flaws. While the gameplay is fantastic it has the problem that a lot
						of games have being that it lets the story delay the gameplay. While i enjoyed the story
						moderately I had trouble retaining that enjoyment when I spent more time listening and 
						reading about the story rather than actually playing the parts of the game I enjoyed.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						For instance, the first chapter of the game has this giant level where you fight one 
						of the smaller bosses in the yakuza gang and his minions several times, this was honestly
						some of the most fun i have ever had in a videogame and it has some of the greatest in-game
						cutscenes ever, it was that perfect balance of violence and comedy that most pieces of art 
						fail horrifically to imitate. Where it fails is that it takes so long setting up its story 
						and taking its time to get you to the gameplay. Seriously, you will spend at least 2 - 3 hours
						before any bit of the premium gameplay and it really bothers me that I couldn’t play more. You
						will spend most of your time wandering around the hub world and reading paragraphs of text learning
						about characters and the story against your will. You have the option to skip pass all the text but 
						you will quickly realize that is a mistake because reading the text is the only way to find your 
						next checkpoint and the only way to know how to progress the story. There are no waypoints, there
						is no notebook that conveniently has all the details you actually want and there are no summaries.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						This was incredibly annoying for me because this meant if i wanted to get to more of the parts 
						that I wanted to I am forced to wander around the city for literally hours until I walk by an 
						invisible barrier and trigger a story scene and hope to god it has some sense of direction inside the 
						cutscene. Don’t forget this game has plenty of side missions as well which all trigger exactly the same
						way so you can easily fall into the trap of doing side missions which aren’t as fleshed out or as fun 
						as the main story missions so this could easily extend your the amount of hours you spend doing something 
						that you don’t want to be doing by a lot.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Now as of right now, I’ve only done the first Yakuza sub boss, learned the third fighting style and 
						I have done a ton of side missions, I am finding it incredibly hard to make any progression in the 
						game and it’s sort of disheartening in my opinion. I like the game but this problem really makes me
						want to stop playing and it’s an easy fix, just put a waypoint on main story quests and it would make t
						he game 10 times better. I’m going to try to play the game a few more times before I drop it and hopefully
						I can solve this problem whether by game guides or by learning about a new mechanic that’s currently hidden.
						Either way, other developers should take note of this. It can easily decrease the quality of your game, 
						whether it being too much of a focus on story or having no direction, this can drive someone like me insane.
						I am a person who really values fun gameplay over everything else and I don’t like doing chores to get to 
						the good parts of your game. Thanks.
