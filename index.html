						Halo is my favourite video game franchise ever, I've been playing it since Halo combat evolved and I wanted to 
						create something dedicated to the series I enjoy so much.
					</p>
					
                    <p>
						Beginning on Nov. 15, 2001, Halo combat evolved shook the gaming industry by introducing a lot of innovative features
						not yet shown in any video game before. The most notable being the 2 weapon system, most first person shooter games
						at the time allowed the player to carry an unlimited amount of weapons, Bungie decided that they wanted thri game 
						to be different and restrict the player to only using 2 weapons at a time. What this did for the entire genre was 
						huge, it forced the player to use strategy as apposed to just walking around aimlessly with every solution to every
						problem. <a id="readmore" href="#">Read More</a>

						If you are ever wondering what is the greatest of the Halo franchise you'll have to look no longer. 
						Halo 3 is simply amazing, you just have to play to understand the depth of this game. It's campaign has you
						following the Master Chief and Cortana again, no surprises there but you will traveling from multiple planets,
						leading several troops, going on a number of solo missions and the final mission is exhilarating. The song
						"One final effort" will never leave your brain once you hear it the first time and that's why it's one of gamings
						most iconic song ever, maybe only beaten by classic Nintendo games. This game is definitely one that has defined the
						7th generation of consoles.

					<p>
						The gameplay is the smoothest of the bunch, there is a balance between everything. You have your melee, gun, equipment, 
						and grenades. It all works out like a slightly more complex game of rock, paper and scissors. gun beats equipment and grenades,
						melee beats gun and equipment, et cetera. et cetera. It's designed under the philosophy of "Easy to pick up, hard to master." and
						it really shows. It is easily one of the deeper FPS games from that era only being rivaled by the classic CS:GO.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I know my explaination to why Halo 3 is so great is a little light, that's because I am forced to hold back. You can finish this
						on my blog! <a href="#">HERE.....NO NO CHECK IT OUT!</a>
